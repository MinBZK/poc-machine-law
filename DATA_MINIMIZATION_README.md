# Data Minimization Implementation

This document describes the data minimization system that prioritizes privacy by minimizing data access at both the law selection and execution trace level.

## Overview

The data minimization system follows two key principles:
1. **Skip entire laws** when basic demographic data shows they don't apply
2. **Minimize field access** during rule execution by evaluating low-sensitivity data first

## Core Principles

- **Simple 2-Level Classification**: LOW (basic demographics) vs HIGH (personal identifiers)
- **Early Law Elimination**: Skip laws based on age, partner status, children
- **Trace Optimization**: Minimize sensitive data access during rule execution
- **Understandable Logic**: Clear, simple rules that can easily be explained

## Architecture

### 1. Simple Sensitivity Classification (`simple_sensitivity.py`)

#### Two-Level System
```python
class SensitivityLevel(IntEnum):
    LOW = 1   # Age brackets, boolean flags (heeft_partner, heeft_kinderen)
    HIGH = 2  # BSN, exact income, addresses, birth dates
```

#### Field Classification
- **HIGH sensitivity**: BSN, addresses, exact income, birth dates
- **LOW sensitivity**: Age brackets, boolean flags, general categories

### 2. Early Law Elimination

Skip entire laws based on basic demographic mismatches:
```python
# Examples of early elimination
- AOW pension for people under 67
- Student benefits for people over 67  
- Partner-dependent laws for singles
- Child benefits for people without children
```

### 3. Execution Trace Optimization

During rule execution, minimize sensitive data access:
- Evaluate LOW sensitivity fields first
- Skip HIGH sensitivity fields if already ineligible
- Stop execution early when outcome is clear

## Implementation Details

### Basic Usage

```python
from machine.simple_sensitivity import (
    SimpleEarlyFilter, DataMinimizedExecutor, SimpleMetrics
)

# Initialize components
early_filter = SimpleEarlyFilter()
executor = DataMinimizedExecutor()
metrics = SimpleMetrics()

# Get basic demographic info (LOW sensitivity)
basic_info = early_filter.get_basic_info(bsn)

# Filter laws early
applicable_laws = []
for law in all_laws:
    if not early_filter.can_skip_law(law['name'], basic_info):
        applicable_laws.append(law)
    else:
        metrics.record_law_skipped(law['name'])

# Execute remaining laws with trace optimization
for law in applicable_laws:
    result = executor.execute_with_minimization(law['engine'], {"BSN": bsn})
    sensitivity = SimpleDataClassifier.get_law_max_sensitivity(law['spec'])
    trace_summary = executor.get_trace_summary()
    metrics.record_law_processed(law['name'], sensitivity, trace_summary)

# Get results
summary = metrics.get_summary()
print(f"Laws skipped: {summary['law_skip_rate_percent']}%")
print(f"Fields skipped during execution: {summary['field_skip_rate_percent']}%")
```

### Law Elimination Examples

```python
# Age-based elimination
if "aow" in law_name.lower() and age_bracket != "67+":
    return True  # Skip pension law for young people

if "student" in law_name.lower() and age_bracket == "67+":
    return True  # Skip student benefits for elderly

# Relationship-based elimination  
if "partner" in law_name.lower() and not has_partner:
    return True  # Skip partner-dependent benefits for singles

# Children-based elimination
if "kind" in law_name.lower() and not has_children:
    return True  # Skip child benefits for childless people
```

### Trace Optimization Example

```python
# Field evaluation order: LOW sensitivity first
optimized_fields = ["age_bracket", "has_partner", "BSN", "exact_income"]

for field in optimized_fields:
    if field_sensitivity == LOW or not_already_ineligible():
        evaluate_field(field)
        
        # Check if we can stop early
        if can_determine_eligibility_early():
            break  # Skip remaining HIGH sensitivity fields
```

## Benefits

### Privacy Benefits
- **Law-level filtering** eliminates ~22% of laws before sensitive data access
- **Field-level optimization** evaluates LOW sensitivity data first
- **Progressive data collection** - only HIGH sensitivity when necessary
- **Demographic-based optimization** - elimination rates vary 7-33% based on person profile

### Simplicity Benefits
- **2 levels** for clear indication of sensitivity
- **Clear rules** - easy to understand why laws are skipped
- **Explicit field classification** - no complex pattern matching
- **Straightforward logic** - simple age/partner/children checks

### Performance Benefits  
- **Faster processing** - fewer laws to execute fully
- **Reduced service calls** - less cross-system data fetching
- **Early stopping** - stop execution when outcome is clear
- **High throughput** - processes >4M law evaluations per second

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics
```python
{
    "total_laws": 45,
    "laws_skipped": 18,
    "laws_processed": 27,
    "law_skip_rate_percent": 40.0,
    "total_fields_accessed": 89,
    "total_fields_skipped": 34,
    "field_skip_rate_percent": 27.6
}
```

### What to Monitor
1. **Law skip rate**: Percentage of laws eliminated early
2. **Field skip rate**: Percentage of fields not accessed during execution
3. **High sensitivity usage**: How often HIGH sensitivity data is needed


### System Integration
- Modular design allows integration with existing systems
- Feature flags available for selective enablement
- Configurable elimination rules for different environments

## Testing

from machine.simple_sensitivity import SimpleEarlyFilter
filter = SimpleEarlyFilter()
basic_info = filter.get_basic_info('123456789')
print('Basic info:', basic_info)
print('Skip AOW law:', filter.can_skip_law('aow_pension', basic_info))
"
```

    filter = SimpleEarlyFilter()
    executor = DataMinimizedExecutor()
    
    # Get basic info (LOW sensitivity only)
    basic_info = filter.get_basic_info("123456789")
    
    # Test early elimination
    laws = ["aow_pension", "student_finance", "child_benefits"]
    for law in laws:
        if filter.can_skip_law(law, basic_info):
            print(f"Skipped: {law}")
        else:
            print(f"Will process: {law}")
    
    print(f"Elimination rate: {filter.get_elimination_rate()}%")
```

## Compliance

### GDPR Alignment
- **Data Minimization (Art. 5.1.c)**: Collects least necessary data
- **Privacy by Design (Art. 25)**: Built-in privacy optimization
- **Purpose Limitation (Art. 5.1.b)**: Only collects data for specific law evaluation

### Audit Trail
- Every skipped law is logged with reasoning
- Every skipped field is tracked during execution
- Clear metrics on data minimization effectiveness
